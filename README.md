# Virus-Spreading-Simulation
## Origin 
This app is a project for Discrete Simulation of Complex Systems classes. We have decided to create a simulation of a pandemy according to novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan.
## Implementation 
After several discussions we came up with an idea of writing this app in two programming languages - Python and C++.
### C++
The low-level traits of this language are widely beneficial for our venture - the essential part of code (simulating spread of pathogen all around the world) is based on two C++ classes - Simulation and Region.
### Python
Famous for various number of graphical libraries, Python is a vital part of our GUI. Using Tkinter we can easily display the results of simulation.
